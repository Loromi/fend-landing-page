## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Documentation

The content sections of index.html are stored into an array. 

For every section a navigation Item is created and appended to the menu-bar. 

If a section is in the viewport it get's highlighted until it leaves the viewport.

When clicking on a navigation item, the default event is prevented to enable smooth scrolling, while highlighting the clicked nav-item.
